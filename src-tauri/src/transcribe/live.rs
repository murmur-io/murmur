//! Best-effort LIVE transcription: a read-only background loop that runs while a recording
//! is in progress. Every few seconds it snapshots the tail of the mic buffer, transcribes
//! that window with Whisper, and emits a [`crate::events::EVENT_LIVE_CAPTION`] event.
//!
//! Design guarantees (so this can never destabilise the core record/transcribe flow):
//! - It only *reads* a clone of the recent samples (`Recorder::snapshot_tail`); it never
//!   drains or mutates the capture buffer.
//! - It self-terminates as soon as the recorder is gone (recording stopped/taken).
//! - Every error (model load, resample, transcribe) is logged and skipped — the recording
//!   and the authoritative final transcript produced at stop are unaffected.
//! - Live quality/latency depends on the chosen model (use a small model for snappy
//!   captions); a slow tick just means less frequent captions, never a broken recording.
